# Autocomplete System using Trie

Autocomplete is a feature that predicts and suggests possible completions for partially typed text, often seen in search engines, messaging apps, and other input fields. It enhances user experience by speeding up text input. This project implements an efficient autocomplete system using a **Trie Data Structure** to ensure fast lookup with minimal memory consumption.

## Problem Statement

Implementing autocomplete functionality with large datasets and limited computational resources is challenging. The goal is to design a system that can quickly find and return suggestions based on a prefix typed by the user, without consuming excessive memory or sacrificing performance.

## Solution: Trie Data Structure

The **Trie** is a tree-like data structure ideal for autocomplete implementations. It stores words in a way that allows searching based on prefixes, making it efficient for autocomplete tasks.

### Key Features:
- **Efficient Prefix Search**: Trie enables rapid lookup of words based on a given prefix, making it ideal for autocomplete.
- **Memory Optimization**: Compared to other data structures like binary search trees, Trie offers a more memory-efficient solution.
- **Fast Lookup**: Lookups are proportional to the length of the word, ensuring quick results within milliseconds even for large datasets.

### How it Works:
1. The user begins typing a word.
2. A character buffer is initialized to store the typed prefix.
3. As each character is entered, it is appended to the prefix.
4. The Trie is searched for all words that start with the given prefix.
5. If the prefix exists, the system returns all possible word completions.

## Technology Stack
- **JavaScript**: Used to implement the Trie data structure and autocomplete functionality.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the interface where the user can interact with the autocomplete system.
- **Node.js** (optional): To run a local server and test the application.

## Installation & Setup

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/autocomplete-trie.git
   cd autocomplete-trie
   ```

2. Run the index.html

## How to Use
1. Start typing a word in the input field.
2. As you type, the autocomplete system will display all possible word suggestions based on the prefix you enter.
3. Click on a suggested word to complete the text input.

## Advantages of Trie for Autocomplete
- **Quick Prefix Matching**: Trie allows rapid matching of words based on a prefix, which is essential for autocomplete systems.
- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Compared to other data structures like hash maps or binary trees, Tries optimize memory by sharing prefixes among words.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for large datasets, ensuring performance doesn't degrade even with extensive word lists.
